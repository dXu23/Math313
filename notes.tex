\section{Irrationality of \(\sqrt{2}\)}
\begin{theorem}
There is no irrational number whose square is 2. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  A rational number is any number that can be expressed in the form \(p / q\),
  where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers. We proceed by contradiction and assume
  that there is a rational number whose square is 2. We also assume that this
  rational number is completely reduced. Then
  \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{r C l"s}
    \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{2} & = & 2 \\
    p^{2} & = & 2q^{2} & So \(p\) must be an even number. Let \(p = 2r\) with \(r \in \mathbb{Z}\) \\
    \left(2r \right)^{2} & = & 2q^{2} \\
    4r^{2} & = & 2q^{2} \\
    2r^{2} & = & q^{2} & WHAT!? So then \(q\) is also even!? But \(p / q\) was supposed to be completely reduced!
  \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
  As we can see, \(p / q\) was supposed to be completely reduced, yet we showed
  that it was not. Therefore, \(\sqrt{2}\) cannot be irrational. 
  
\end{proof}
