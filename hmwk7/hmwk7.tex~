\textbf{Exercise 3.2.2}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item
  The limit points for \(A\) are 1 and -1. To see why, simply let
  \(a_{n} = A_{2n}\) and \(b_{n} = A_{2n - 1}\), which are sequences contained
  in \(A\). Then \(a_{n} = 1 + 1 / n\) and \(b_{n} = -1 + 2 / (2 n - 1)\). 
  We can use the Algebraic limit theorem to show that \(a_{n}\) converges
  to 1:
  \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{r C l"s}
    \lim \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right) & = & \lim (1) + \lim \left(\frac{1}{n}\right) & by (ii) of Theorem 2.3.3 (Algebraic Limit Theorem) \\
    & = & 1 + 0 \\
    & = & 1
  \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
  We can show that \(b_{n}\) converges to -1 through the definition of the limit.
  For any arbitrary \(\epsilon > 0\), choose \(N > 1 / \epsilon + 1 / 2\). Then
  for all \(n \geq N\),
  \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{r C l"s}
    n & > & \frac{1}{\epsilon} + \frac{1}{2} \\
    2n & > & \frac{2}{\epsilon} + 1 \\
    2n - 1 & > & \frac{2}{\epsilon} \\
    \left|\frac{1}{2n - 1} \right| & < & \frac{\epsilon}{2} & since \(n\) and \(\epsilon\) are both positive \\
    \left|\frac{2}{2n - 1} \right| & < & \epsilon \\
    \left| -1 + \frac{2}{2n - 1} - (-1)\right| & < & \epsilon \\
    \left| b_{n} - (-1) \right| & < & \epsilon
  \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
  Therefore, \(b_{n}\) converges to -1, so -1 is a limit point of \(A\).
  The limit points for \(B\) are all real numbers between 1 and 0. We can
  use the same argument as Example 3.2.9 (iii).
\item Set \(A\) is neither open nor closed. We choose the element 2 from the
  set \(A\), which we must show does not contain any \(\epsilon\)-neighborhoods that
  are a subset of \(A\). For 2 to contain a \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood, there must be
  an element \(a \in A\) such that \(a > 2\). However, it is not to hard to see that
  there is no such \(a\). Consider the sequences we defined before, \(a_{n}\) and
  \(b_{n}\). If we defined two sets to contain the elements of \(a_{n}\) and \(b_{n}\),
  and took the union of those sets, we would get \(A\). So if we can show that \(a_{n}\)
  does not contain any elements greater than 2 and \(b_{n}\) does not contain any elements
  greater than 2, then we can conclude that 2 does not have any \(\epsilon\)-neighborhoods
  that a subset of \(A\). So we assume to the contrary that \(a_{n}\) does contain an
  element greater than 2. Then for some \(n\), \(1 + 1 / n > 2\). However,
  \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{r C l}
    1 + \frac{1}{n} & > & 2 \\
    \frac{1}{n} & > & 1 \\
    n & < & 1
  \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
  However, \(n\) must be a natural number, so it cannot be less than 1. Now we assume that
  \(b_{n}\) contains some element greater than 2. Then there exists some \(n\) such that
  \(-1 + 2 / (2n - 1) > 2\). However,
  \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{r C l}
    -1 + \frac{2}{2n - 1} & > & 2 \\
    \frac{2}{2n - 1} & > & 3 \\
    \frac{2n - 1}{2} & < & \frac{1}{3} \\
    2n - 1 & < & \frac{2}{3} \\
    2n & < & \frac{5}{3} \\
    n & < & \frac{5}{6}
  \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
  As stated before, \(n\) must be a natural number, so \(n\) cannot be less
  than \(5 / 6\). Thus, \(b_{n}\) does not contain an element greater than 2.
  So, if neither \(a_{n}\) and \(b_{n}\) does not contain an element greater
  than 2, then \(A\) does not contain an element greater than 2; therefore,
  there is no \(\epsilon\) neighborhood for 2 that is a subset of \(A\) and
  \(A\) is not open.

  To show that \(A\) is closed, we just have to show that there is a limit point
  that \(A\) does not contain. We consider -1. In order for \(A\) to contain
  -1, there must be an element in \(A\) for which \(-1 = (-1)^{n} + 2 / n\).
  However,
  \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{r C l}
    (-1)^{n} + \frac{2}{n} & = & -1 \\
    \frac{2}{n} & = & -1 - (-1)^{n} \\
    \frac{2}{n} & = & -2 \textrm{ or } 0
  \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
  Then \(n\) be equal to -1. However, \(n\) cannot be equal to -1, since \(n\)
  must be a natural number. And \(2 / n\) is never equal to 0. Therefore,
  the set \(A\) is closed. 
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Exercise 2.3.3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open but not closed. 
\item Closed but not open. Choose 1. Since there are no natural numbers less than 1, then
  there is no \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood for 1 that is a subset of the natural
  numbers.
\item Open but not closed. 0 is most certainly a limit point of \(\{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \neq 0\}\),
  but is not in the set.
\item
  \item CLosed.
